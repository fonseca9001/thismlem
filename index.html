                <br><br>

                <em>In March 2020, in Lisbon, a patient of a well-known psychiatrist drew the face of a man who had been repeatedly appearing in her dreams. On multiple occasions, This Mlem had led her through OSR adventures, referring to himself as Mlem. The woman insisted she had never encountered this "Mlem" in her waking life.</em>
                <br>
                <em>The portrait remained forgotten on the psychiatrist's desk for a few days until another patient recognized the face. He revealed that the man often expressed his deep fascination and love for NTR (Not Safe For Work content involving romantic partners being unfaithful) within his dreams. Strangely, the patient had never encountered this man in reality.</em>
                <br>
                <em>Intrigued, the psychiatrist decided to share the portrait with colleagues who had patients experiencing recurring dreams. Within a few months, four other patients identified the man as a frequent presence in their own dreams. In some instances, he was running Dungeon World games, while in others, he was drawing obscure and unconventional artwork. All these patients referred to him as THIS MLEM.</em>
                <br>
                <em>From August 19th 2019 to the present day, approximately 2000 individuals from the rpgportugal discord server have claimed to have encountered this enigmatic figure in their dreams, spanning various cities worldwide, including Los Angeles, Berlin, São Paulo, Tehran, Beijing, Rome, Barcelona, Stockholm, Paris, New Delhi, Moscow, and more.</em>
                <br>
                <em>Curiously, there is no discernible connection or common thread among those who have dreamed of encountering This Mlem. Furthermore, no living person has ever been identified as resembling the man depicted in the portrait by those who have seen him in their dreams.</em>

    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I have had this recurrent dream for some years now. A tall, dark man, who I now recognize as This Mlem, shows me a picture and asks me if I can recognize my father in it. The man in the picture is This Mlem, a figure I have never seen before, who looks nothing like my dad. Nevertheless, I inexplicably answer that I do recognize my father. At this point, I usually wake up feeling very peaceful. Other times the dream continues. I am standing before my father’s grave, I place some flowers on the ground, and I realize the photograph on the tombstone is missing. This surreal encounter often transitions into a tabletop RPG scenario where This Mlem guides me through bizarre adventures, discussing the Unabomber manifesto's philosophical aspects."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I fell in love with him from the very first time I saw him in my dream. Even though, if I think about it, I must admit This Mlem is really peculiar. And yet, each and every time, he sweeps me off my feet with his romantic gestures and sweet words. He buys me flowers, jewelry, takes me out to dinner, or to the beach to watch the sunset. In our dream world, we explore realms inspired by Warhammer 40k, battling cosmic entities and discussing veganism as a way of life."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I have always had this dream of flying in the sky over my city and observing my friends from up there. Since I moved to another house, I started meeting This Mlem while flying. Not every single time that I have this dream about flying, but often enough. He flies too, but he never speaks. Together, we soar through the skies, pondering the mysteries of Warhammer 40k lore and the wisdom of flight attendants, all while embracing the concept of driving slowly in our dream adventures."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"The first time I had a dream about This Mlem, I was having a hard time at work. I had a dream about getting lost in a huge and deserted shopping mall. Suddenly, This Mlem appeared and I started running away from him. He chased after me for what seemed like an hour until I found myself against a wall in the kids’ area in a supermarket. At this point, he smiled at me and he showed me the way out towards the cash desks, and I woke up. Ever since that night, This Mlem has appeared in all of my dreams, and he always gives me directions to get out of the dream and wake up. Our dream encounters often involve philosophical discussions about veganism, the Unabomber manifesto, and the wisdom of flight attendants, all while appreciating the beauty of driving slowly in surreal dreamscapes."</em>

    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I have never had homosexual relationships or even fantasies. But I dream about having experiences with This Mlem all the time. I must admit he has a lot of imagination and he pleases me. Sometimes when I wake up, I discover I have had a nocturnal emission. In these intimate dream moments, we explore the boundaries of veganism, indulge in the complexity of tabletop RPG scenarios, and discuss the Unabomber manifesto while cherishing the wisdom of flight attendants and embracing the concept of driving slowly in our dream realm."</em>

                <strong>THE MYSTICAL MLEM THEORY</strong><br>
                <em>According to this theory, This Mlem is a mystical entity that transcends the earthly realm. It is believed that he is a messenger who communicates through dreams to guide the dreamers on a quest for existential mlemness.</em>
