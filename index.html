                <strong>HISTORY</strong>
                <br>
                <em>In October 2023, in Lisbon, a patient of a well-known psychiatrist drew the face of a man who had been repeatedly appearing in her dreams. On multiple occasions, this man had led her through OSR adventures, referring to himself as Mlem. The woman insisted she had never encountered this "Mlem" in her waking life.</em>

                <em>The portrait remained forgotten on the psychiatrist's desk for a few days until another patient recognized the face. He revealed that the man often expressed his deep fascination and love for NTR (Not Safe For Work content involving romantic partners being unfaithful) within his dreams. Strangely, the patient had never encountered this man in reality.</em>
            
                <em>Intrigued, the psychiatrist decided to share the portrait with colleagues who had patients experiencing recurring dreams. Within a few months, four other patients identified the man as a frequent presence in their own dreams. In some instances, he was running Dungeon World games, while in others, he was drawing obscure and unconventional artwork. All these patients referred to him as THIS MLEM.</em>
            
                <em>From August 19th 2019 to the present day, over 2000 individuals have claimed to have encountered this enigmatic figure in their dreams, spanning various cities worldwide, including Los Angeles, Berlin, Sao Paulo, Tehran, Beijing, Rome, Barcelona, Stockholm, Paris, New Delhi, Moscow, and more.</em>
            
                <em>Curiously, there is no discernible connection or common thread among those who have dreamed of encountering This Mlem. Furthermore, no living person has ever been identified as resembling the man depicted in the portrait by those who have seen him in their dreams.</em>

    <strong>DREAMS</strong>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I have had this recurrent dream for some years now. A tall, dark man, who I now recognize as This Mlem, shows me a picture and asks me if I can recognize my father in it. The man in the picture is This Mlem, a figure I have never seen before, who looks nothing like my dad. Nevertheless, I inexplicably answer that I do recognize my father. At this point, I usually wake up feeling very peaceful. Other times the dream continues. I am standing before my father’s grave, I place some flowers on the ground, and I realize the photograph on the tombstone is missing. This surreal encounter often transitions into a tabletop RPG scenario where This Mlem guides me through bizarre adventures, discussing the Unabomber manifesto's philosophical aspects."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I fell in love with him from the very first time I saw him in my dream. Even though, if I think about it, I must admit This Mlem is really peculiar. And yet, each and every time, he sweeps me off my feet with his romantic gestures and sweet words. He buys me flowers, jewelry, takes me out to dinner, or to the beach to watch the sunset. In our dream world, we explore realms inspired by Warhammer 40k, battling cosmic entities and discussing veganism as a way of life."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I have always had this dream of flying in the sky over my city and observing my friends from up there. Since I moved to another house, I started meeting This Mlem while flying. Not every single time that I have this dream about flying, but often enough. He flies too, but he never speaks. Together, we soar through the skies, pondering the mysteries of Warhammer 40k lore and the wisdom of flight attendants, all while embracing the concept of driving slowly in our dream adventures."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"The first time I had a dream about This Mlem, I was having a hard time at work. I had a dream about getting lost in a huge and deserted shopping mall. Suddenly, This Mlem appeared and I started running away from him. He chased after me for what seemed like an hour until I found myself against a wall in the kids’ area in a supermarket. At this point, he smiled at me and he showed me the way out towards the cash desks, and I woke up. Ever since that night, This Mlem has appeared in all of my dreams, and he always gives me directions to get out of the dream and wake up. Our dream encounters often involve philosophical discussions about veganism, the Unabomber manifesto, and the wisdom of flight attendants, all while appreciating the beauty of driving slowly in surreal dreamscapes."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I have never had homosexual relationships or even fantasies. But I dream about having experiences with This Mlem all the time. I must admit he has a lot of imagination and he pleases me. Sometimes when I wake up, I discover I have had a nocturnal emission. In these intimate dream moments, we explore the boundaries of veganism, indulge in the complexity of tabletop RPG scenarios, and discuss the Unabomber manifesto while cherishing the wisdom of flight attendants and embracing the concept of driving slowly in our dream realm."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I saw This Mlem in my dream, dressed as Santa Claus. When he showed up, I felt so happy, just like when I was a little girl. Then he smiled at me and his head became a balloon, floating in the air above me. But no matter how hard I tried to catch it, I just couldn’t reach it. In this whimsical dream world, we delve into the mysteries of Warhammer 40k, discuss the profound teachings of the Unabomber manifesto, and appreciate the art of driving slowly while engaging in surreal adventures guided by flight attendants."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I dreamt of This Mlem when I was in the 10th grade. He hasn’t been in any recurring dreams, just one very memorable and terrifying dream. In my dream, I was stuck in a room sitting on a stool. A few feet away from me, there was a television set. I was ‘visited’ by two men I had never seen before (not ‘this man’) and they both attacked me. I woke up covered in sweat and tears and I was screaming. I somehow fell asleep, then I found myself back in the room. I started screaming and crying. Then This Mlem showed up on the screen. I begged him to not harm me. He didn’t change his blank expression or speak. He slit my throat, and I woke up. I suppose he let me out of the nightmare, but I couldn’t stop thinking about him for weeks. I still have some of the sketches I drew of him. I know it’s kind of weird. In this nightmarish yet intriguing dream, we confront the enigmas of the Unabomber manifesto, unravel the secrets of Warhammer 40k lore, and navigate through the complexities of veganism. Our encounters with flight attendants provide unique insights, all while appreciating the art of driving slowly in a surreal dream reality."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I dreamt This Mlem was in my mirror watching me, saying nothing, and he was wearing glasses. He never moved the entire time I saw him, he was like a statue, so still. In this eerie and mysterious dream, we explore the depth of the Unabomber manifesto, delve into the intricate world of tabletop RPGs, and find solace in the teachings of Warhammer 40k. The presence of flight attendants adds an intriguing layer to our dream interactions, all while embracing the concept of driving slowly in our surreal encounters."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I dreamt This Mlem was Brazilian and very handsome. He was a schoolteacher type with 6 fingers on his right hand. He said if the US had a nuclear disaster: go North! In this vivid dream scenario, we explore the cultural richness of Brazil, discuss philosophical aspects of the Unabomber manifesto, and engage in tabletop RPG adventures set in the universe of Warhammer 40k. Flight attendants with unique perspectives join our discussions, all while appreciating the art of driving slowly in our dream journeys."</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="dream">
        <em>"I have seen This Mlem in 3 completely different dreams. He was slightly different from the picture, but I recognized him immediately. He appeared suddenly and disappeared in the same manner. His message in all 3 of my dreams was: 'It’s all over.' That was repeated 3 times in each dream. The differences in the picture and the man in my dreams are: his hair was a little longer on the top; his eyebrows were not as bushy. Other than that, he is identical. I had no fear of him, but many questions. In these enigmatic dream encounters, This Mlem guides us through the labyrinth of the Unabomber manifesto, immerses us in tabletop RPG scenarios from diverse universes like Warhammer 40k, and explores the philosophical depths of veganism. The wisdom of flight attendants adds a surreal touch to our conversations, all while savoring the serenity of driving slowly in our dream explorations."</em>
