            <em>
              In March 2020, in Lisbon, a patient of a well-known psychiatrist drew the face
              of a man who had been repeatedly appearing in her dreams. On multiple occasions,
              This Mlem had led her through OSR adventures, referring to himself as Mlem.
              The woman insisted she had never encountered this "Mlem" in her waking life.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              The portrait remained forgotten on the psychiatrist's desk for a few days until
              another patient recognized the face. He revealed that the man often expressed
              his deep fascination and love for NTR (Not Safe For Work content involving
              romantic partners being unfaithful) within his dreams. Strangely, the patient
              had never encountered this man in reality.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              Intrigued, the psychiatrist decided to share the portrait with colleagues who
              had patients experiencing recurring dreams. Within a few months, four other
              patients identified the man as a frequent presence in their own dreams. In some
              instances, he was running Dungeon World games, while in others, he was drawing
              obscure and unconventional artwork. All these patients referred to him as
              THIS MLEM.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              From August 19th 2019 to the present day, approximately 2000 individuals from
              the rpgportugal discord server have claimed to have encountered this enigmatic
              figure in their dreams, spanning various cities worldwide, including Los
              Angeles, Berlin, São Paulo, Tehran, Beijing, Rome, Barcelona, Stockholm,
              Paris, New Delhi, Moscow, and more.

              Curiously, there is no discernible connection or common thread among those who
              have dreamed of encountering This Mlem. Furthermore, no living person has ever

              have seen him in their dreams.

              my father in it. The man in the picture is This Mlem, a figure I have never
              seen before, who looks nothing like my dad. Nevertheless, I inexplicably answer
              that I do recognize my father. At this point, I usually wake up feeling very
              peaceful. Other times the dream continues. I am standing before my father’s
              grave, I place some flowers on the ground, and I realize the photograph on the
              tombstone is missing. This surreal encounter often transitions into a tabletop
              RPG scenario where This Mlem guides me through bizarre adventures, discussing

              This Mlem has appeared in all of my dreams, and he always gives me directions
