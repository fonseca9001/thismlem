                    <em>In October 2023 in Lisbon, the patient of a well-known psychiatrist draws the face of a man that has been repeatedly appearing in her dreams. In more than one occasion that man has run OSR adventures for her, calling himself Mlem. The woman swears she has never met this "Mlem" in her life.
                        That portrait lies forgotten on the psychiatrist's desk for a few days until one day another patient recognizes that face and says that the man has often exclaimed his profound interest and love for NTR in his dreams. He also claims he has never seen that man in his waking life.
                        The psychiatrist decides to send the portrait to some of his colleagues that have patients with recurrent dreams. Within a few months, four patients recognize the man as a frequent presence in their own dreams, in some he is running Dungeon World games, in others drawing furry inflation pornography. All the patients refer to him as THIS MLEM.
                        From October 2023 until today, at least 2000 people have claimed they have seen this Mlem in their dreams, in many cities all over the world: Los Angeles, Berlin, Sao Paulo, Tehran, Beijing, Rome, Barcelona, Stockholm, Paris, New Dehli, Moskow etc. 
                        At the moment there is no ascertained relation or common trait among the people that have dreamed of seeing this Mlem. Moreover, no living man has ever been recognized as resembling the man of the portrait by the people who have seen this Mlem in their dreams.</em>

                           <li>to understand who this Mlem is and why he appears in an apparently pattern-less array of situations in the dreams of such diverse human subjects.</li>
