   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"I have had this recurrent dream for some years now. A tall, dark man shows me a picture and asks me if I can recognise my father in it. The man in the picture is this man I have never seen before, he looks nothing like my dad, nevertheless I inexplicably answer that I do recognize my father. At this point I usually wake up feeling very peaceful. Other times the dream continues, I am standing before my father's grave, I place some flowers on the ground and I realise the photograph on the tombstone is missing."</em>
<br><br> 

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"I fell in love with him from the very first time I saw him in my dream. Even though if I think about it I must admit he's really ugly. And yet each and every time, he sweeps me off my feet with his romantic gestures and sweet words. He buys me flowers, jewellery, he takes me out to dinner or to the beach to watch the sunset."</em>
<br><br> 

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"I have always had this dream of flying in the sky over my city and observing my friends from up there. Since I moved to another house I started meeting this man while flying. Not every single time that I have this dream about flying, but often enough. He flies too, but he never speaks."</em>
<br><br> 

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"The first time I had a dream about this man I was having a hard time at work. I had a dream about getting lost in a huge and deserted shopping mall. Suddenly this man appeared and I started running away from him. He chased after me for what seemed like an hour until I found myself against a wall in the kids' area in a supermarket. At this point he smiled at me and he showed me the way out towards the cash desks and I woke up. Ever since that night this man has appeared in all of my dreams and he always gives me directions to get out of the dream and wake up."</em>
<br><br> 

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"I have never had homosexual relationships or even fantasies. But I dream about having sexing with this man all the time. I must admit he has a lot of imagination and he pleases me. Sometimes when I wake up I discover I have had a nocturnal emission."</em>
<br><br>


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"I saw this man in my dream, dressed as Santa Klaus. When he showed up I felt so happy, just like when I was a little girl. Then he smiled at me and his head became a balloon,floating in the air above me, but no matter how hard I tried to catch it, I just couldn't reach it."</em>
<br><br>


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"
I dreamt of this man when I was in the 
10th grade. He hasn't been in any 
recurring dreams just one very memorable 
and terrifying dream. In my dream I was stuck in a room 
sitting on a stool. A few feet away from 
me there was a television set. I was 
'visited' by two men I had never seen 
before (not 'this man') and they both 
attacked me. I woke up covered in sweat 
and tears and I was screaming. I somehow 
fell asleep then I found myself back in 
the room. I started screaming and 
crying. Then This Man showed up on the  
screen. I begged him to not harm me. He 
didn't change his blank expression or 
speak. He slit my throat and I woke up. 
I suppose he let me out of the nightmare 
but I couldn't stop thinking about him 
for weeks. I still have some of the 
sketches I drew of him. I know it's kind 
of weird."</em>
<br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"
I dreamt this man was in my mirror
watching me, saying nothing, and he was
wearing glasses. He never moved the
entire time I saw him, he was like a
statue, so still."</em>
<br><br>


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"
I dreamt this man... was Brazilian and 
very handsome. He was a schoolteacher 
type with 6 fingers on his right hand. 
He said if the US had a  nuclear 
disaster: go North!"</em>
<br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"
I have seen this man in 3 completely different dreams. He was slightly different from the picture, but I recognized him immedialely.
He appeared suddenly and disappeared in the same manner. His message in all 3 of my dreams was:" It's all over". That was repeated 3 times in each dreams. The differences in the picture and the man in my dreams are: his hair was a little longer in the top; his eyebrows were not as bushy. Other than that, he is identical. I had no fear of him, but many questions."</em>
